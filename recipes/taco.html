    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Most of us grew up eating ground beef tacos in a crispy corn shell or a soft flour tortilla, with lots of toppings.  That’s the traditional taco we’re making in this recipe.  But, we’re not using a pre-packaged taco seasoning mix.  This recipe uses a flavorful homemade taco seasoning.</p>
    <p>Lean ground beef is the best beef to use for making tacos because you don’t need to drain off any fat after cooking it. There is just enough fat in the beef to make it super flavorful, but not so much to make it greasy.  Skipping the step to drain the fat makes this a quick and easy taco recipe.</p>
    
    
    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. 90% to 93% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper/li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>12 taco shells - either hard shells or small 6-inch soft flour tortillas will work</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Instructions:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the beef to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break the meat apart with a wooden spoon. Add the chili powder, cumin, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper to the meat. Stir well. Cook until the meat is cooked through, about 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the tomato sauce and water. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes, until some of the liquid evaporates but the meat mixture is still a little saucy. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Warm the taco shells according to their package directions.</li>
        <li>Fill the taco shells with 2 heaping tablespoons of taco meat. Top with desired taco toppings: shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, diced red onion, taco sauce, sour cream, guacamole, etc.</li>
    </ol>
